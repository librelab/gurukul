16** sequences events and reads hour time on clocks

Achievements<br>

a) Understanding the Concept of Time<br>

Skill: Rishaan understands the concept of time as the progression of events from the past through the present and into the future.<br>
Evidence: Rishaan demonstrates the ability to explain what time means in simple terms.<br>
Example: Rishaan explained that "time tells us when things happen" during a discussion about daily routines.<br>

b)Sequencing Events<br>

Skill: Rishaan sequences events in chronological order based on their occurrence.<br>
Evidence: Rishaan correctly orders events such as waking up, Brushing teeth, having breakfast, playing cricket, reading book, Writing practice, playing racing game in a typical daily routine/Rishaan correctly orders the different space shuttle orbiters along with the prototype orbiter.<br>
Example: Rishaan in a quiz time named 6 space shuttle orbiter namely Enterprise, Columbia, challenger, Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour.<br>

c) Reading Hour Time on Clocks<br>

Skill: Rishaan reads and interprets the hour time on analog clocks.<br>
Evidence: Rishaan can identify the position of the hour hand and determine the corresponding hour.<br>
Example: Rishaan correctly reads the hour time as 3 o'clock when the hour hand points to the 3 on the clock face.<br>

d) Using Time Language<br>

Skill: Rishaan uses appropriate language to describe time-related concepts.<br>
Evidence: Rishaan uses terms such as "o'clock," "morning," "afternoon," "evening," and "night" to describe different times of the day.<br>
Example: Rishaan said, "It's 8 o'clock in the evening," when asked about the time during dinner.<br>

e) Applying Time Concepts<br>

Skill: Rishaan applies time concepts in practical situations, such as daily routines and scheduling activities.<br>
Evidence: Rishaan follows daily routines and schedules activities based on specific times of the day.<br>
Example: Rishaan knows when it's time to brush teeth before bed and when it's time to have lunch during the day.<br>

MAE-DATA-01<br>
18** contributes to collecting data and interprets data displays made from objects

Achievements<br>

a) Understanding the Concept of Data<br>

Skill: Rishaan understands the concept of data as information collected for analysis or interpretation.<br>
Evidence: Rishaan demonstrates the ability to explain what data means in simple terms.<br>
Example: Rishaan explained that "data is information we gather to learn something" during a discussion about counting objects.<br>
${\color{Red}Status: \ \color{green}Working \ at \ expected \ level}$<br>

b) Participating in Data Collection<br>

Skill: Rishaan actively participates in data collection activities by counting and sorting objects.<br>
Evidence: Rishaan counts and sorts objects based on different attributes such as color, size, or shape.<br>
Example: Rishaan helped count and sort Dominos building block in red and blue during automatic Domino train play session.<br>

c) Interpreting Data Displays<br>

Skill: Rishaan interprets simple data displays made from objects.<br>
Evidence: Rishaan can make observations and draw conclusions based on data displays such as pictographs or bar graphs.<br>
Example: Rishaan looked at a pictograph showing the favorite colors of cars and noticed that blue was the most popular color - Prodigy app .<br>

d) Using Data Language<br>

Skill: Rishaan uses appropriate language to describe data-related concepts.<br>
Evidence: Rishaan uses terms such as "more," "less," "most," "least," "many," and "few" to describe data.<br>
Example: Rishaan said, "There are more red domino building block than blue domino building block," when playing with automatic domino train .<br>

e) Applying Data Concepts<br>

Skill: Rishaan applies data concepts in practical situations, such as making comparisons and predictions based on data.<br>
Evidence: Rishaan uses data to make decisions or predictions, such as which room has greater number of metal studs based on self carried out survey.<br>
Example: Rishaan predicted that bathroom has greater number of metal studs compared to bed room and hall, based on the study done using metal stud detector.<br>
